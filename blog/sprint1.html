  <!-- is it okay to have multiple style sheets or is it better practice to make individual i guess i could have multiple style sheets? Research is saying that this is an inefficient way to do things, i guess i need to get better at controlling my tags so that i can individualise pages-->

      My name is Daniel Ashby, and I reside in Glendene, Auckland.
      Inquisitive, Empathetic, and Analytical are three attributes that I would most align myself with. Inquisition drives my love to learn and share in those learnings. One of my core philosophies is that everyone has the potential to teach you something, which drives my empathy. I like to break down information into smaller parts to digest, which is why I put analytical as my third value. I have spent most of my career applying those values as an, ocean sediment analyst, teaching assistant, meat microbiologist, vegan ice cream producer, and beer taster and tester. 
      </p><p>
      The reason why I am attending Dev Academy is because I think web development, and programming at its core has great opportunities and so much flexibility. I have had moments in my career where I wished I had these skills, and have tried to learn them in the past without putting in the amount of time it deserves. This is me adding myself to the stage to fully commit and reach the cloud of software engineering (humour is also an important value to me, git it? Iâ€™ll stop now). In all seriousness Dev Academy seems like the right teaching style for me to build some great skills and habits for a future steeped in technology.

  Looking forward to working with you all!
