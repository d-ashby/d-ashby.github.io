      Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.

      When I was very young I stole an item from a family friend while I was visiting them, I can't remember what the item was, some small figurine that i thought was awesome. However when I returned home with my new found bounty I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and I couldn't function anymore. I returned the figurine and apologised, and all was well again. Doing the right thing by people I interact with is important to me.

      Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
    </h3></div>
    <p>
      My family has instilled the value of independence, I have always been encouraged to do what I want with my life and make my own path.<br><br> I grew up with an older brother, so I would often be exposed to things that kids my age had not yet had the chance to experience. We were nerds, we loved videogames and still do. I guess that is where my fascination with technology started, embarrasingly with a sega megadrive and sonic the hedgehog at the age of 3! <br>

      <div><h3>
        Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
      </h3></div>
      <p>
        My strength is my drive to learn, my inquisitiveness. That is also my limitation as I can lose focus on what really matters at the time. I can be easily distracted.
      </p>
      <div><h3>
        An example of trying to be productive with others, but resistance and tension was present
      </h3></div>
      <p>
        I was trying to hang a mirror with two other people, a large mirror too. All three of us had a different idea on how to hang the mirror and we all executed the plan at the same time. We had similar ideas that varied slightly, we started off thinking 'yes they get it! This is going well'. When the variation in plans started to appear arguments started, <br><br><em>
       "no dont use the measuring tape use the spirit level"  <br><br>
       "dont put toothpaste on the back that wont leave a mark" <br><br>
       "hold this corner and move to me" <br><br>
       "to me? no... to you!"<br><br></em>
       The haste to be the first to hang the mirror led us to leave out most of the planing stage where it couldve been far more organised and stressless as we all had great ideas, and in the end we all worked together to hang the mirror perfectly! Discussion, and talking things out is so valuable yet it can be often overlooked.
