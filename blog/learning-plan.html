        <div><h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3></div>
        <p>
          To become skilled enough to land a job as a software developer, it's too early to say specialties i want to focus on. Fundamentally I want to be in a position where I am able to learn more and be with other people who love to learn too.
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          A description of your strengths and limitations concerning learning
        </h3></div>
        <p>
          My strength is my drive to learn, my inquisitiveness, I suppose that is also my limitation as I realise I will need to keep focused on what really matters at the time. I also need to work on the core side of my skills not just technical! 
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3></div>
        <p>
          I would like to build on my interpersonal skills and confidence with being out of my comfort zone socially. Be more social!
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives?
        </h3></div>
        <p>
          I find it easier to learn when my body is kept healthy. Taking regular breaks, exercise, good sleep, and a healthy diet are my aims for my physical wellbeing (something I struggled with!). I hope that I will be able to keep my mental wellbeing healthy through being social and connecting with others, and be present for others who seek my council. If I keep these things in check I will be the best me for peers, facilitators and all others I will be interacting with during this bootcamp. 
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?
        </h3></div>
        <p>
          I hope that by making a commitment and keeping to the steps I mentioned above, I won’t reach this point. But if I feel like I am losing my footing, I will have to reassess my position and seek advice from my peers and facilitators.
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
        </h3></div>
        <p>
          I will do my best to communicate any failings on my side. I will do what I can to contribute in the tenacity and success of the team.
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
        </h3></div>
        <p>
          I expect the facilitators to guide and facilitate learning.
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        </h3></div>
        <p>
          I am lucky enough to give my full attention during this bootcamp.
