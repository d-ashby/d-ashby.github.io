      <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people. </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      Understanding how the brain works, is a key step to being able to flex that organ. Neural pathways can be created and strengthened, the evidence is all around us. One sad example I have is from one of my teachers at high school. He was naturally left handed, but as a child he was forced by his teachers to use his right hand, a strange thing to enforce someone to do, however it’s a small piece of anecdotal evidence that demonstrates that the mind is capable of growth and change. This isn’t the best example, growth mindsets shouldn’t be enforced. If we think about it from the perspective of my teacher, it wouldve taken lots of time and practice to become able to build those neural connections to be able to write with the non intuitive hand. <a href="

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>What is a growth mindset, and why is it important?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
     A fixed mindset is admitting to a philosophy of you are who you are with a statue like tenacity. I will never run faster. I will never swim. I will never learn multiplication. If you catch yourself having a fixed mindset moment try to think about why? Having a growth mindset is the opposite of a fixed mindset, “I can if" is the new motto here. Change the reason why you can’t do something to a way that could help you achieve something. I can’t hold my breath that long -> I can hold my breath that long if I practiced more.

      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      I have been exposed to the concept of a growth mind before, I have noticed that it is easy to lose sight and really apply it on a daily basis. This was a good refresher towards having a growth mindset, which I personally think is such a powerful way to reorient oneself and get the most out of life.

      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>

    <p>
      When challenges seem insurmountable, not to focus on the tyranny of now, relish in the chance of yet. Remember to reward the process not the finish line. Something that I am constantly trying to improve on and be mindful of. <a href="https://youtu.be/-71zdXCMU6A"style='color: teal;'>Here</a> is a resource that i found helpful when researching growth mindsets, it's a talk with Carol Dweck.
