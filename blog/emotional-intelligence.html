        <div><h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3></div>
        <p>
          A person with high EQ is someone who is capable of being 'moved', being able to understand the emotions of another. Being capable of expressing ones own emotions. Using a combination of ones own emotions and those around them to guide thoughts and behaviour. 
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          How is it different to IQ?
        </h3></div>
          IQ or intelligence quotient is a measure of intelligence, this measurement takes into consideration visual and spatial processing, general knowledge, fluid reasoning, memory, and quantitative reasoning. Emotional quotient or EQ is a persons ability to accept control and express emotions. This is measured on ability to identify emotion, evaluating others, controlling expression, and ability to relate and communicate effectively. 
        </p>
   
        <div><h3>
         Why is it important?
        </h3></div>
        <p>Having the ability to think before reacting will lead to better outcomes when exposed to emotionally charged interactions. Being angry and responding can alter your approach or how you present yourself which could lead down an undesirable path. For example imagine you're angry that Steven stole your sandwich, assess your anger and think why this situation might be, perhaps Steven had his sandwich in a brown paper bag too? Reassessing the reason why youâ€™re angry with something can reduce the chances of it happening again and you will be in a better place to approach the problem calmly. 
          <br>
        Greater self awareness, having a strong sense of empathy towards others helps understand what you may also be exposed to. Or if it is something you have experienced you may be able to help direct others to better outcomes. <br>
