      <h2>Le Depuzzlement</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>A time that i was blocked (was the whole time this week) </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>what was the problem?</li>
        - I still struggle to recall javascript I often draw blanks as to how to start or tackle a problem. 
        <li>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</li>
        - I attempt to break down the problem that is to be solved, and try write good pseudocode to accompany it.
        <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>
        - It is a tricky one! It's like learning to draw or paint, I can visualise what I want but I don't quite have the techniques sorted, and it feels like im painting M.C. Escher.
        <li>What did you learn?</li>
        - The journey is going to take lots of practice! Keep making progress future me! 
      </ul>
    </p>
    <div>
      <h3>An elegant solution?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>what was the problem?</li>
        - Shaking off a fixed mindset, and developing a growth mindset.
        <li>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</li>
        - I talked with people and took some time to think about it, and revisited some of the growth mindset material.
        <li>How did you feel throughout the process?</li>
        - That this is very challenging, and being challenged is a good sign, I have progress to make. 
        <li>What did you learn?</li>
        - When challenges seem insurmountable, not to focus on the tyranny of now, relish in the chance of yet. There was no elegant solution this week! haha XD
      </ul>

    <div>
      <h2>Problem solving techniques</h2>
    </div>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pseudocode</strong></li>
        - Pseudocode is verbalising the code. For example “ I want to add number a to number b and then post the result”. This is easier said than done! I feel like this is my key learning tool at the moment even if my pseudocode is wrong, it challenges my mind to think in the way that the code could work. 
        <li><strong>Trying something</strong></li>o
        - I always try and tackle something first, even if it is garblegoop!    
        <li><strong>Rubber ducky method</strong></li>
        - A rubber duck is great, trying to create sentences and hearing them puts that information in a new light and things may appear for what they truely are. I chat with a miniature viking that has a giant beard.   
        <li><strong>Reading error messages</strong></li>
        - Often syntax is picked up and posted into the console, I always seem to forget a curly bracket, thanks error messages. 
        <li><strong>Console.logging</strong></li>
        - This is useful for printing out smaller chunks of code. It’s a house of cards and sometimes checking things one by one by commenting things out and console logging lets me know whats going on. I find it helpful for understanding what the wild code that ive found on the web does. 
        <li><strong>Googling</strong></li>
        - google has some sweet tools built in that help refine searches.Using key words is great applying operators to those keywords can yeild more accurate results, its strange that google doesnt have an easily accesible list of these operators. Here is a blog post explaining operators: <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/"style='color: teal;'>Google Operators</a>  
        <li><strong>Asking your peers for help</strong></li>
        - Something I need to work on! 
        <li><strong>Asking coaches for help</strong></li>
        - Something I need to improve.
        <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong></li>
        - Dedicating a small amount of time to planning, and then time to process what has been completed has been helpful in creating , and new angles to approach my learning. 
      </ul>
