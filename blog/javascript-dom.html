      <div><h2>JavaScript fundamentals</h2></div>
        <div><h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3></div>
        <p>
          JavaScript acts as a programming 'layer' to the elements rendered by the browsers interpretation of HTML and CSS. HTML represents the elements of a page where css applies style to those elements and is then rendered as what is known as the Document Object Model (DOM for short). Javascript can further manipulate this DOM to add elements, styles, and other more complex interactions. 
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects
        </h3></div>
        <p>
         <strong>Control Flow</strong> relates to how javascript is read by the browser. It runs in a sequential order from top to bottom i.e. first line to the last line of code. <br>
         <strong>Loops</strong> are used within javascript to do a certain task repeatedly. <br>
         <div>
          <img src="../loopy.png" alt="loop" width="565px" height="279">
        </div>
        <br>
        Above we can see a loop that generates 5 highfives! loops are like little clips that rewind and play a certain sequence of events a number of times. What the clip is and how many times it plays is up to the details specified by you. In this example 5 high fives were made because 4 is just not enough! 
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <p><strong>Arrays</strong> <em>the modern day Pandoras box</em> except you're the god who can fill the box, no need for misery and evil, lets put numbers and strings inside instead. Within this box(array) of numbers and words, it is remarkably organised for a box with limitless space, as if the items are all lined up in a row. for example we can call upon items within the aray as they are in a numbered order otherwise known as indexed positions.
          <div>
          <img src="../pokemon.png" alt="pokemon" width="622px" height="260">
          </div>
          if you were to select pokemon [0] you would pick Bulbasaur (excellent choice). 
        </p>  
        <div><h3>
          Functions and why they are useful
        </h3></div>
        <p>
          I would like to build on my interpersonal skills and confidence with being out of my comfort zone socially. Be more social!
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          The DOM and DevTools
        </h3></div>
        <p>
          I find it easier to learn when my body is kept healthy. Taking regular breaks, exercise, good sleep, and a healthy diet are my aims for my physical wellbeing (something I struggled with!). I hope that I will be able to keep my mental wellbeing healthy through being social and connecting with others, and be present for others who seek my council. If I keep these things in check I will be the best me for peers, facilitators and all others I will be interacting with during this bootcamp.
