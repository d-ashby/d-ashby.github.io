      <div><h2>JavaScript fundamentals</h2></div>
        <div><h3>JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h3></div>
        <p>
          JavaScript acts as a programming 'layer' to the elements rendered by the browsers interpretation of HTML and CSS. HTML represents the elements of a page where css applies style to those elements and is then rendered as what is known as the Document Object Model (DOM for short). Javascript can further manipulate this DOM to add elements, styles, and other more complex interactions. 
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          Control flow and loops, arrays, and objects
        </h3></div>
        <p>
         <strong>Control Flow</strong> relates to how javascript is read by the browser. It runs in a sequential order from top to bottom i.e. first line to the last line of code. <br>
         <strong>Loops</strong> are used within javascript to do a certain task repeatedly. <br>
         <div>
          <img src="../loopy.png" alt="loop" width="565px" height="279">
        </div>
        <br>
        Above we can see a loop that generates 5 highfives! loops are like little clips that rewind and play a certain sequence of events a number of times. What the clip is and how many times it plays is up to the details specified by you. In this example 5 high fives were made because 4 is just not enough! 
        </p>
        <br>
        
        <p><strong>Arrays</strong> <em>the modern day Pandoras box</em> except you're the god who can fill the box, no need for misery and evil, lets put numbers and strings inside instead. Within this box(array) of numbers and words, it is remarkably organised for a box with limitless space, as if the items are all lined up in a row. for example we can call upon items within the aray as they are in a numbered order otherwise known as indexed positions.
          <div>
          <img src="../pokemon.png" alt="pokemon" width="622px" height="260">
          </div>
          if you were to select pokemon [0] you would pick Bulbasaur (excellent choice). 
        </p>  
        <p><strong>Objects</strong> in the scope of javascript are standalone entities. they hold a collection of properties, these properties hold values. for example a telephone is an object, that telephone has a rotary dial, a colour, a size, all of these are properties of the object.
            <div>
            <img src="../ericssonDialog.png" alt="rotoryPhone" width="622px" height="260">
            </div>
        Here we can see an object myTelephone which has a numberinput of a <em>rotory</em> style, the model is a <em>Ericsson Dialog</em> from the year <em>1964</em>.
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          Functions and why they are useful
        </h3></div>
        <p>
        <strong>Functions</strong> are a compilation of tasks to achieve a certain goal. The great thing about this is that it can be reused. For example if we were to go to the zoo and have to write out code everytime we wanted to pat the animal that would be a long day at the zoo, it might close before we see all the animals. Functions can help out here. 
          <div>
          <img src="../patAnimal.png" alt="animal" width="622px" height="279">
          </div>
        now every time we meet a new animal we can type 'pat(tiger)' and it will say "hello there tiger please let me pat you". Maybe we should figure out a function that grows limbs before we pat the tiger.  
        </p>
        <div><h3>
          The DOM and DevTools
        </h3></div>
        <p>
         The DOM or document object model is like a portal through which javascript interacts with the HTML and CSS. The DOM compiles the components within the html and css and then in turn allows a programming language to interact with those components that make up the webpage.   
         <br>
         Chrome DevTools is an in browser tool that shows the components that make up the webpage. its like looking at the engine that makes the car move. devtools allows you to access specific points within the webpage and change them on the fly and see those changes in realtime. want to change that title to read penguins instead of wikipedia? lets do it...
