      <h1>End of Sprint Reflection</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? </h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      - Egos can make or break the situation that is life - balance is key
      <br>
      - Always keep learning and improving - its too rewarding to not
      <br>
      - Watching the cadence in development - take time to reflect
    </p>
    <div>
      <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      - They enable a community to work and learn together
      <br>
      - Different values brings different approaches to problems 
      <br>
      - Self awareness allows reflection on how a program is being built, or how relationships are being built. 
     
    </p>
    <div>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      - The process and framework of a ‘coding’ mindset, is something that I have experience with from previous study/jobs. Being more habitual is something I need to work on! 
    </p>
    <div>
      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      - Cementing healthy habits, I still remain flexible. Sometimes I get into the ‘zone’ and continue through without taking breaks. The opposite can also be true.
    </p>
    <div>
      <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      - Programming in a work environment will be quite a sociable thing. Collaboration will be a key component to making good software but also be happy while doing it. 
    </p>
    <div>
      <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      - I see the value, not only do we need technical skills, we need people skills to be the best representation of ourselves and become productive learners. The core skills are like experience multipliers!
